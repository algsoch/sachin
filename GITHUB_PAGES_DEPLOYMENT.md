# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide - edited.frame

## ✅ **READY FOR GITHUB PAGES!**

Your contact form is now optimized for GitHub Pages deployment with your actual credentials configured.

### 🎯 **What's Configured**
- ✅ **Formspree**: `https://formspree.io/f/mzzvlvel` (Primary)
- ✅ **Discord Webhook**: Working and tested
- ✅ **Email Recipients**: connectwithsachin06@gmail.com & npdimagine@gmail.com
- ✅ **Security**: Sensitive PHP files protected by .gitignore

### 📧 **Email Flow for GitHub Pages**
1. **Formspree** (Primary) → Sends to both email addresses
2. **EmailJS** (Backup) → Client-side email service
3. **Discord Webhook** (Notification) → Instant alerts
4. **Direct Contact** (Fallback) → Shows email for manual contact

### 🔐 **Security Features**
- Gmail app password secured (not exposed to client)
- Sensitive PHP files excluded from GitHub
- No API keys exposed in frontend code
- Discord webhook works without server-side code

## 🚀 **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

### Step 1: Commit Safe Files Only
```bash
git add index.html
git add css/
git add js/main.js
git add assets/
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "🎬 Contact form ready for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Settings → Pages
3. Source: Deploy from branch `main`
4. Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Save

### Step 3: Test Your Live Site
- Visit: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]`
- Test contact form with real submission
- Check both email addresses receive messages
- Verify Discord notifications

## 📱 **What Happens When Someone Submits**

### ✅ **Successful Submission (Formspree)**
1. **Professional Email** sent to both addresses:
   - connectwithsachin06@gmail.com (primary)
   - npdimagine@gmail.com (CC)
2. **Discord Rich Embed** with form details
3. **Success Message**: "✅ Message sent successfully!"
4. **Form Reset**: Clears automatically

### 🔄 **Backup Methods**
- If Formspree fails → EmailJS attempts delivery
- If EmailJS fails → Discord notification only
- If all fail → Direct email message shown

## 🛡️ **Files Protected from GitHub**
- `gmail-smtp.php` (contains app password)
- `contact.php` (server-side email handler)
- Any `.env` files

## 🎬 **Custom Domain (Optional)**
